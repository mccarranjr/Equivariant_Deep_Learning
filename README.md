# Equivariant_Deep_Learning
Final project for 6.s966 - Symmetry and its Application to Machine Learning and Scientific Computing

The project uses DiffDock, a Euclidiean Neural Network to minimize the energy of a protein ligand system according to a Molecular Dynamics based force field. We use DiffDock to minimize the potential eergy of a bound ligand pose when only considering torsion angles as degrees of freedom.


As this is a class on equivariant deep learning, the motivation behind this project was to see how an equivariant model that has already been trained (DiffDock) could be used for a task that has built in S0(3) invariance (PE minimization).
